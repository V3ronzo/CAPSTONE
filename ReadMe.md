This is the "W.W.G.N." APP! 
A SIMPLE TRAVEL APP THAT IS STRICLY FOR LOOKING UP PLACES, READING REVIEWS, CREATING A PERSONAL ITENERARY , CHECKLIST. 

USERS CAN LOG IN / CREATE AN ACCOUNT. UPLOAD PICTURES, GIVE REVIEWS, AND CREATE A CHECKLIST LIKE WHAT TO PACK OR WHERE TO GO OR FAVORTIE PLACES ETC... 

I DON'T WANT IT TO BE A BOOKING APP JUST A COMMUNITY OF FELLOW TRAVERLERS TO TALK AND SWAP STORIES . 
and the user can created a checklist/tasklist/itenarary for themselves.  

The reviews section can just be read like social media posts and/or users can search for specific locations /events by using "#". The hashtag is also how users will start their reviews.
